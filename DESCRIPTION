Package: ROOXML
Version: 0.2-0
Title:  Simple tools for Open Office XML documents
Description:  This is a collection of some general and quite simple facilities accessing common 
  elements  from within R of an Open XML document, Microsoft's current format.
  These provide examples for accessing the contents of the document and its meta-data.
  More will be added for modifying the content, and also reading richer structures
  such as worksheets, etc. 
  At present, this is more an illustration of what is possible and a way to encourage others
  to explore these documents.  We can do very similar things for OpenOffice documents. (See
  ROpenOffice for a start.)
  Some of the functionality currently in this package will be moved to a separate
  package for Word, and some functionality already exists in RExcelXML.
  In this way, this package will provide the functionality common to two or more
  Open XML document formats.
